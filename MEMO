Title: Memo on how observe observes process executions

<Work In Progress>


= State Transitions =

== States ==
<initial> ::
    initial state
<handling> ::
    captured an exec and handling it
<hooking> ::
    found a matching hook and running its actions
<observing> ::
    letting process run and waiting for capturing an exec

== Transitions ==
<initial>       -[ begin ]->    <handling>
<handling>      -[release]->   <observing>
<handling>      -[ match ]->     <hooking>
